#Here is the song hash you will be working with. Each key is a song name and each value is the location of it's mp3 file.
#make sure to edit the value of each key to replace < path to this directory >
#with the correct path to this directory on your computer

def list(my_songs)
  #this method is different! Collect the keys of the my_songs hash and 
  #list the songs by name
end


def play(my_songs)
  #this method is slightly different!
  #you should still ask the user for input and collect their song choice
  #this time, only allow user's to input a song name
  #check to see if the name they give is in fact a key of the my_songs hash
  #if it isn't, tell them their choice is invalid
  #if it is, play the song using the system 'open <file path>' syntax
  #get the file path of the song by looking it up in the my_songs hash
